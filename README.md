Data Analytics 2018 project by team 221B_Baker_Street, on Agriculture analysis and building an effective prediction model

The Prediction Model has been designed to make predictions in the agriculture sector
The model focuses on predicting

~ The total land area used for the production of crops and to evaluate the revenue of each of the crop.
~ To provide an efficient overview of how to use the fertilizers and pesticides in the best possible way so as to increase production and make an optimal investment.
~ The right time to sow seeds and harvesting crops by studying the different weather patterns.
~ Compare the cost of the products at the grocery stores and the actual cost of the product in the field and to provide a better investment idea for the farmer so as to get a profit for both the farmer and the customer.
~ Analyzing the historical data of the crops and to predict which plants will provide a maximum yield during particular seasons.
~ The use of data and analytics to help farmers hedge against potential losses and smooth out cash flow, which is always a concern in any agriculture operation
